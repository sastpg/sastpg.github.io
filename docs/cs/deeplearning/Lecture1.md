# Introduction

## Machine learning

!!! note "Definition"
    Machine learning is to equip the machine with the ability to "**look for a function**".

However it may be too complex for humans to write the function in many tasks. Hence we expected to utilize the machine to find the function out automatically.

## Different types of functions

**Regression: **The function outputs a scalar.

**Classification: **Given options (classes), the function outputs the correct one.

***Structured Learning***: Create something with structure(like image, document, etc.). To be specific, it aims to equip the machines with the creativity(LLMs like chatGPT).
